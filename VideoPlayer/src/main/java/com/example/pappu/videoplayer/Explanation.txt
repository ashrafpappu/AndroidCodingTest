VideoPlayer functionalities:
Play,
Forward,
Rewind

As my video player consists of Play, Forward, Rewind functionalities and they are independent states of video player
and request to play,forward,rewind need to be handled at variant times,i think command design pattern is appropriate for this player.
I am assuming that if users press my player play button then the action will be only play the video and after that it will not alter its
state.For example if user press second time in play button the player will not go in pause state.

My video player consists of one Command interface and three  concrete classes of it.
I have created a VideoController which takes user request and send encapsulated request to Videoplayer receiver.
